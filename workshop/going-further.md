## A note on declarative vs imperative

Imperative programming is like *How* you do something and declarative programming is more like *What* you do.

An example is worth a thousand words:

Let's say you have a night out with your friends and decide to go to a restaurant. When you reach the reception desk, you say:

* imperative (How): My friends and I are looking for a table to eat. I see there is one available in the back next to the window. We are going to walk, sit there and have dinner.
* declarative (What): Table for four, please.

The secret to understand the difference is to accept that the declarative approach always has an *underlying imperative abstraction*. In the previous example, we assume that the receptionist knows all the steps to get you to the aforementioned table.

With React, you declare your components and update their state to trigger a re-render of the concerned components.
